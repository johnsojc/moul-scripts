Plasma engine scripts used by Myst Online

This repository is a fork from the moul-scripts repository found in the Guild of Writers H-uru repositories.
The pep8 branch project is an attempt to clean up the scripts to meet the PEP-8 style of coding standards.

These scripts will be reformatted to meet the PEP-8 standard with the exception of line length. PEP-8 wants comment lines < 72 characters and all other code lines < 80. Since this code is used on modern computers with large resolution displays and no teletypes or other 80 column output devices needed, the decision was made not to limit the length of lines to fit on an 80 column punch card. Welcome to the future!
